- various challenges with modern web development:
- level of interactivity/sophistication of web applications has increased (JS frameworks, AJAX, HTML5)
- user expectations are up as well
- more browsers than ever that need to be supported (IE 8-11, mobile browsers etc)
- smartphone, tables, personal computers  -one app different screensizes (responsive design)
- click-testing won't do (anymore), too many variations. too costly.

???
- test automation: this includes unit tests, but not only. full end-to-end test (system tests) thru the UI needed.
- SCM, git svn, github bitbucket. gives you version control and collaboration tool. many dev branches, one stable mainline.
- build automation: build scripts, build server.
- self-building tests: tests are part of the codebase and executed as part of the build
- all of these together -> continous integration
- which leads us .. (next slide)

- Travis will just keep building your site over and over.  You can test in a ton of browsers
and even allow some of them to fail without your entire build failing.
- Build matrix can be HUGE
- The 'name' in capabillities gives you an easy way to find the problem is suace

##Securing your Key
]
.right-column[
- Travis provides an easy way to secure you sauce labs access token.
- Unfortuantly it breaks tests on Pull Requests.

@setone
Scenario: Advance to next slide
  Then I should see the 1st slide

@settwo

???
- Sauce tests take a while to run, and Travis has a 40 minutes maximum run time.
- Profiles and tags allow the tests to be split into parts
- You could get more complicated here and group builds that are allowed to fail in certain browsers
or use tags to organize more specifically.
