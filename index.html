# Agenda

- Behaviour Driven Development
    - Behat/Mink/Selenium/Browsers
- Continuous Integration
    - Github, TravisCI, SauceLabs

We will walk you through this process from the basic setup to our more advanced tips and tricks.

The best part is all of our work is open source so you can take home both an understanding of
these technologies and some real-world examples to start from.
